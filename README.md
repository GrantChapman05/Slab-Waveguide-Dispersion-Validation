# Slab-Waveguide-Dispersion-Validation
Creating Cross-validation of planar waveguide dispersion relations through analytical modeling (MATLAB) and numerical simulation (COMSOL), with Python post-processing and visualization.

This project is to simulate how an Emag-field propagates between 2 silicon dioxide layers. The goal is to model optical models and validate maxwells equations in a real world simulated photonic application of COMSOL, MATLAB and Python.
