# Slab-Waveguide-Dispersion-Validation
Creating Cross-validation of planar waveguide dispersion relations through analytical modeling (MATLAB) and numerical simulation (COMSOL), with Python post-processing and visualization.

This project is to simulate how an Emag-field propagates between 2 silicon dioxide layers. The goal is to model optical models and validate maxwells equations in a real world simulated photonic application of COMSOL, MATLAB and Python.

BASE PARAMETERS:
thickness -> t = 220nm
refractive index of silicon -> n_core = 3.48
refractive index of silicon dioxide -> n_slabs () = 1.444
wavelength -> λ = 1550 nm

FUTURE VARIABLE PARAMETERS FOR VALIDATION:
t = {160, 190, 250, 280} nm
λ = {1500, 1600} nm
