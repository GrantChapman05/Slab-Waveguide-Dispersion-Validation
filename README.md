# Slab-Waveguide-Dispersion-Validation
Creating Cross-validation of planar waveguide dispersion relations through analytical modeling (MATLAB) and numerical simulation (COMSOL), with Python post-processing and visualization.

This project is to simulate how light propagates through a thin silicon layer between 2 silicon dioxide layers. The goal is to model and find maxwells equations in a real world simulated application of comsol, matlab and python.
